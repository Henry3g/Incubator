A project about the Banking industry according to Data from Linkedin
A dataset from Linkedin is used in this project.

From 09/14/2015 to 07/17/2018, information from the banking industry was updated the most frequently. That somehow means that companies from the banking industry can be one of the most important customers for Linkedin. So it's very important to know the main players in this area and how they developed, in order to predict their future development. 
The number of employees can show the size of the company. I the biggest company in the banking industry, the Bank of America, to analyze.
Firstly, I did some research on the increaing rate of the bank of America.
Secondly, I focused on the share of Bank of America among the whole banking industry.
From the two steps, I can roughly know the development of Bank of America and the banking industry.
In the future, more analysis can be done to know more details in the banking industry and the same processes can be applied to analyze other industries.

Step 1: Find Top 3 companies in the banking industry according to their numbers of employees.(draw graphs for Top 1 company)
        plot(time vs. number of employees)
        plot(time vs. increasing rate)
        I found out that its development is steady recently. And there is a mass recruitment among these 4 years. But maybe it was because the company started encouraging their employees to use Linkedin at that time.
        further research can be conducted in the future for that 'mass recruitment'

Step 2: Analyze Top 3 shares in the whole industry.(draw a graph for Top 1 company)
        plot(time vs. share)
        I drew the graph which shows the number of employees among all employees in the banking industry.
        From this graph, it shows that the share of BOA in the banking industry is decreasing.
        Maybe it's because that other banks are growing up. Maybe Linkedin can pay more attention onto fast-growing banks.

Future steps: Analyze more companies, provide specific services for different banks, maybe some small and fast-growing companies.
