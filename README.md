A project about the Banking industry according to Data from Linkedin
From 09/14/2015 to 07/17/2018, information from the banking industry was updated the most frequently. That somehow means that companies from the banking industry can be one of the most important customers for Linkedin. So it's very important to know the main players in this area and how they developed, in order to predict their future development. 
Step 1: Find Top 3 companies in the banking industry according to their numbers of employees.(draw graphs for Top 1 company)
        plot(time vs. number of employees)
        plot(time vs. increasing rate)
        I found out that its development is steady recently. And there is a mass recruitment among these 4 years. But maybe it was because the company started encouraging their employees to use Linkedin at that time.
        further research can be conducted in the future for that 'mass recruitment'

Step 2: Analyze Top 3 shares in the whole industry.


Future steps: find increasing rates of these three companies and then provide more specific services for these companies.
